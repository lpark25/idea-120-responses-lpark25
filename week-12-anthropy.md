<h1>Anna Anthropy, Rise of Videogame Zinesters: Chapter 1 and 2</h1>

<p>As a lover of videogames, I truly believe that videogames are a form of art. There is so much planning and creative process that takes place when making a videogame. I find that the beauty in videogames is that it can be a manifestation of whatever the creator wants it to be. It can tell a specific story or be complete nonsense. But regardless it can take the player into a completely new environment and instill a new experience. This is specifically why I think it's crucial to stress the importance of making videogames accessible for all.</p>
