<h1>Lisa Nakamura, Digitizing Race: Introduction</h1>

<p> Reading this passage I understood Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure," as meaning that the tools we utilize are rooted from the mind of a designer. In a society where we have access to all sorts of digital platforms, people often fail to realize that these sites and tools we use were created by the minds of designers. Starting from basic sketches to the careful consideration of each element of user interface and user experience. Designers work to create the most polished product with the thought of the user in mind. Therefore, digital products and services are usually manifestations of a group of designer's ideas merged into one final, ultimate conclusion. Thus by stating that it asks us to "identify with someone else's mental structure," I took it as meaning that we are looking into the thought process of the designer when we use interactive media. And by using these types of media, we are adopting and accepting the decisions and structures that the designer thought of and produced.</p>

<p>One of the digital tools I use the most is Spotify. One thing that I always noticed about Spotify was the simplicity of its interface design. The menu bar has only the necessary options and thus eliminating clutter. I think this goes to show that the designers strived to make this an app that would be easily accessible and usable for a wide range of ages. Further, they allow for free listening with ads and limited skipping amounts (on mobile), this shows the creators desire to allow Spotify to be accessible for people who may not be able to afford a monthly subscription. It emphasizes their desire to allow the option of a free platform while making profit so their company can continue to function. Also, Spotify allows you to interact with other users by sharing playlists or following artists/users. It shows that Spotify was also created with the consideration that it would be an app that would allow socialization through the basis of music. </p>
