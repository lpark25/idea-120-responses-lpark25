<h1>Cathy O'Neil, Weapons of Math Destruction</h1>

<p>In Cathy O'Neill's "Weapons of Math Destruction." she writes that WMDs are are a reflection of using data that is flawed as an algorithm that are used to make decisions. Further, O'Neill states that to the normal person WMDs are opaque but that they really are everywhere. One of the most concerning factors of WMDs is the way that the data is stolen from the victim without their awareness. Also that it just creates a cycle of feedback that produce the same flawed results.</p>

<p>An example that I thought of while reading this was the recent situation with Robinhood and their manipulation of user's stocks. Robinhood advertises their app as a way to give the masses the leisure and ease of investing in stocks. They claim they are a brand that strives to assist amateur stock traders. However, it was found that Robinhood is actually in secret blocking small retail investors and was providing hedge funds for other big elite investors. This was further exposed when Redditors joined forces to surge the stock prices of Gamestop as a way to prove the power of the people. Only to be blocked by Robinhood preventing trading on Gamestop making stocks fall rapidly.</p>

<p>It's evident that there is a cycle in which the average masses information is manipulated, but is done in secrecy by big corporations. The truth is that the ability for powerful corporations to be able to have access to and utilize the average person's data creates a cycle of harm for the masses. It's a power-led cycle that enforces the poor to stay poor and the rich to keep getting richer. Thus, as O'Neill claims, influences the amplification of inequality for the lower-class and the average person.</p>
