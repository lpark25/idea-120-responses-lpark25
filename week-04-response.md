<p>An example that of a kind of image that would be read different if seen on another medium are attraction photos from tourist websites and pamphlets. When these kinds of scenic attraction photos are viewed on tourism websites, the audience associates the scenery with the country or location. The photos serve as a representation of the location's beauty and pride that differentiates it from other places. But also it serves to plant into the viewer a desire to visit this specific location. </p>

<p1>On the contrary, when these type of scenic photos are posted on an influencer's instagram page the viewers tend to have a different opinion. The audience sees photos of beautiful places on influencer's instagrams and tend to associate it to the influencer rather than the location. It often makes people think "oh, this influencer went on a luxurious vacation" rather than considering the photos for tourist attraction purposes. </p1>

<p22>In images like this, the denoted linguistic message would be the literal meanings of what's written. For an image like this it would be the location, Arizona, and the slogan they've adopted, "Your story starts..." The connoted message would be the implication that visiting this place can provide a new sense of freedom and beginning. Second, the denoted image would be the literal scene of the woman doing yoga in front of the mountains of Bell Rock Sedona. Lastly, the symbolic message of the image would be that yoga is a symbolism of peace and harmony in the body and mind. It gives the implication that this location will bring you full peace and healing.</p2>
