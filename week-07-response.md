<h1>Janet Murray, Hamlet on the Holodeck: Chapter 9</h1>

Create a new markdown document in your 'idea-120-responses' folder called 'week-07-response.md' and discuss in about 2 paragraphs if you agree with the problems and solutions laid out by Bridle. Bridle has a specific vision for what the internet 'should be'. Do you agree with this vision?


What I will argue, on the basis of these cases and of those I’m going to describe further, is that the scale and logic of the system is complicit in these outputs, and requires us to think through their implications.


<p>I think that Bridle brings to light a very serious and urgent topic that needs to be discussed. The issues that Bridle mentions are not ones that people are unaware of, rather I think that it's a problem people know of but don't bother to fight against. Especially with modern technology, Bridle is right in that everything is way too easily accessible. I definitely agree with Bridle in that platforms like Youtube fail to properly regulate the harmful things that emerge due to the systemic algorithm. I've experienced such situations as well, where I've had youtube videos just playing on the side with autoplay turned on. Often times, it'll take me down a rabbit-hole of weird things completely unrelated to the original video I started with. Things like this prove to show the way that Youtube utilizes its algorithm to find even one similar keyword which will link a bunch of random videos together. It truly is a dangerous field when you think about it. The potential of young children being exposed to dangerous content all because of people or AI manipulating the algorithm.</p>

<p>Bridle mentions how "the system is complicit in the abuse." I believe this to be true as well. Children are so easily swindled in their thoughts and the things they are exposed to at a young age drastically effect their development. Knowing how accessible platforms like Youtube and Google are for even children, these platforms need to be more aware and make stronger efforts to regulate content. Like Bridle states, these platforms absolutely have a responsibility to deal with issues like this. The intention of using the algorithm as a means of profit by feeding children unrelated and harmful content is truly unacceptable. Further, the deeper issue seems to lie with people who greed for profit over the wellbeing of who is exposed to toxic content. Which is why we can't trust people who have access to the internet to be clean or appropriate. Rather, there needs to be a stronger implementation to what kind of content is available and who it is available for. </p>
