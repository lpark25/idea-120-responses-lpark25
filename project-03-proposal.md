<h1>Non-linear Narrative</h1>

<p>In the past I wrote this narrative about a potato harvest.</p>

<p>Buried beneath depths of grimy dirt, mounds speckle the mass of sinking land.
Darkness envelops a sliver of light that punctuates the abyss.
Inches below, cold grains surround bulbous bodies.

Droplets bead the ground. Dark water sloshes against streams of muddy sludge.
Days pass in silence, reflecting their hushed bodies resting beneath the soil.

Suddenly, ripping through the blanketed stillness, boils of ravishing skin rip away at the seams of their taut exterior.
Bursting their core, limbs struggle to the surface aching for air.
Stretching. Spreading. Arms breaking the hollow barrier to bask in the glory of light.
Scent of flowers fills the lungs.

Still sunken beneath the heavy weight of the earth, carcass fragments remain.
Time seems to stand still as bodies multiply in a never-ending cycle of fate.
Desiring to escape, their bulging bodies touch, like sandpaper against smooth skin.

Weight lifts as months of furrowed soil uncovers the dirty aftermath.
Luscious labor-worthy brown lumps appear above ground announcing their potential.
