<h1>Green Screen Proposal</h1>

<p>For the green screen project, I want to play with the illusion of size within the space. The scene will start with me in the zoom call with my dog on my lap. Eventually, I will put her on the ground and she will disappear from the frame. Then she will emerge from the back and walk up to me only for her to become massive in size. Then my larger than life dog will interact with a normal-sized me.</p>
