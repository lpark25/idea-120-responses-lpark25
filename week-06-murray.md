<h1>Janet Murray, Hamlet on the Holodeck: Chapter 9</h1>

<p>
If I am honest, I found the way that Janet Murray decided to present her predictions to be a bit droning. In the sense that all the examples of shows and stories she used to make her point were ones that I wasn't very familiar with. So, Murray discussing certain parts of scenes were just confusing for me and weren't very relatable.

<br> However, I do understand Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments. I think at the rate that society develops and the constant societal desire for new technological experiences it is definitely a possibility for future development. We already have elements like Virtual Reality and videos or games that interact with the viewer's choices. So, to develop this form of virtual interaction to tv shows and programs on a more expansive level is something I believe is possible for the future. Further, it is definitely something that can be brought to people's daily platform such as the mobile phone. I think it's safe to say that, in modern society, people spend the most time on their phones or laptops. So, it seems like a natural process that this reinvention of storytelling would be made accessible on smaller mobile devices and increase on-the-go users. 

<br>While Murray discusses the boundary of interaction between the audience and the narrative, it raises the question of how we can utilize certain technologies as a bridge between humans interacting with digital space. I think watching 'The Mandalorian' video really emphasized this idea. It explored the interconnection between the actors and virtual reality and how the combination of these digital and physical elements can create something amazing. Further, it emerges the actors in the moment. They are not just acting with a screen of green, but they are now able to visual and experience the grandness of this world that the character is emerged in. But also, for the viewers, it can create a more realistic viewing experience. Many times CGI can go wrong very easily and that ruins a lot of the experience that comes from watching movies or shows with otherworldly concepts. But by using LED walls and projecting 3D environments, it shows real reflections and lighting that adds to the overall viewer experience.  


<br> I believe that many people fear the rapid development of technology but ,in reality, it is something that we should embrace for it is the inevitable.
