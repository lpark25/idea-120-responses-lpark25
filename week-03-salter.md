In this week's reading, "Entangled", Chris Salter writes about German composer Richard Wagner's term known as Gesamtkunstwerk. Although a seemingly confusing concept to understand, Wagner seems to depict Gesamkunstwerk as a "total work of art." As a reader, Wagner's description of Gesamtkunstwerk can be interpretated as a piece of work that synthesizes the many forms of art. This idea can be seen in many works in the modern world today but one field that seems to embody Gesamtkunstwek is in video game designing. Video game designing requires the harmony of digital and physical tools in order to create a well-rounded game that becomes a pleasing experience to all the senses. Video game designing requires creation of scores for music, character and environment designing, script writing for dialogue and story, actors for character voices and body motion, as well as coding interactions.
