<h1>Example of Gesamkunstwerk Modern Society</h1>

<p>In this week's reading, <i>Entangled</i>, Chris Salter writes about German composer Richard Wagner's term known as Gesamtkunstwerk. Although a seemingly confusing concept to understand, Wagner seems to depict Gesamkunstwerk as a "total work of art." As a reader, Wagner's description of Gesamtkunstwerk can be interpretated as a piece of work that synthesizes the many forms of art. This idea can be seen in many works in the modern world today but one field that seems to embody Gesamtkunstwek is in video game designing. Video game designing requires the harmony of digital and physical tools in order to create a well-rounded game that becomes a pleasing experience to all the senses. Video game designing requires creation of scores for music, character and environment designing, script writing for dialogue and story, actors for character voices and body motion, as well as coding interactions. These fields of music, drama, literature, theater, costume, design, and programming all work together when considering the creation of a large-scale interactive RPG video game and therefore is an example of Gesamtkunstwerk. </p>

<p2>Another example of Gesamtkunstwerk, seen in the Rhizome Anthology, that seems to stand out is Olia Lialina’s <i>My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</i>. As the piece tells the deep narrative of a woman who is reunited with her partner, the audience can't be helped but to feel moved with emotions. The work combines the use of digital and theatrical tools by utilizing coding and cinematic aspects. With Lialina's interest in cinema and use of "browser frames, hypertext, and images (both animated and still)", she brings them together to create a net space that heightens what we understand of memories. But it also seems to explores and challenge the way that our memories and stories are shared with others. Most commonly modern society shares stories through social media or in person but it doesn't provide the same emotions and experiences that the individual felt in that moment. But with Lialina challenging the idea of storytelling and using multiple fields to create a final piece, it proves that we can physically experience and visually see the emotions that individuals felt in their memories. Thus the harmony that Lialina brings to coding and cinema creates a stronger end product and shows Gesamtkunstwerk through the synthesis of programming and theater.</p2>
